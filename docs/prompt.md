"Build a visually impressive, inspiring, and mobile-first personal portfolio website for a modern Indian politician. The site should blend cultural heritage and optimism, highlight achievements and vision, and communicate trust and relatability to a broad audience. It must include sections for the leader’s background, manifesto, news/events, campaigns, personal media (photos/videos), public initiatives, testimonials, contact, and easy access to social media—with subtle artistic Indian elements, clear calls-to-action, and bilingual (English/telugu) support. Prioritize accessibility, modern front-end standards, and compelling storytelling."
