Your news website classifies articles into clear categories with distinct purposes, now refined with the association between news categories and profile content:

1. **Side Stories, Regular Stories, and Exclusive Stories (News Category):**

   - These belong to the main **news content** classification.
   - **Side Stories:** Shorter, timely pieces shown in sidebars for quick updates.
   - **Regular Stories:** Standard news articles forming the main feed.
   - **Exclusive Stories:** High-priority, “burning” news with distinct highlight and layout.
   - Purpose: These categories allow dynamic tagging based on time and importance, designed to deliver relevant, up-to-the-minute information with visual hierarchy.
   - All of these stories link to the **Editorial Story** page format for full article reading.

2. **Magazine Stories (Profile Content):**

   - These belong to **profile-focused content**, often detailed feature stories or special coverage about notable individuals.
   - Published as stand-alone rich, multimedia-focused articles—highlighting the personality or theme in depth.
   - Purpose: To humanize subjects, inspire, and engage readers with comprehensive narratives.

3. **Editorial Stories (Reading Format):**
   - This is the **unified full-article reading page** used to display the detailed content of side, regular, exclusive, and magazine stories when clicked.
   - It provides immersive reading with multimedia, extended text, and supplementary related content.

### Overall Clarified Purpose:

- The **news category stories** (side, regular, exclusive) serve fast-moving current events with priority and layout adaptations, delivering information based on recency and editorial importance.
- The **profile category (magazine stories)** gives special attention to individuals, allowing for narrative depth beyond headline news.
- This structure enhances user experience by guiding readers through a hierarchy of stories—quick updates to deep profiles—while maintaining editorial workflow and visual design coherence.

This classification balances realtime news delivery with storytelling richness, helping readers easily navigate current trends and in-depth profiles within your news website.
